# August 2nd, 1922; Peak of Arkham Mountains
### Randolph Carter's Main Hall

<p>Seeing nothing else of importance in this room, you leave
it in search for more evidence.</p>

<p>However, exiting Carter's bedroom, you hear two things at
once which would prove to be your demise: a door opening and
a rat scurrying. The opening door comes from that which you
used to enter the house, while the scurrying rat very distinctly
comes from behind you. You begin to retreat to the place whence
you came, you are stopped in your tracks by a creature, neither
resembling an animal nor a human, although able to be approximated
as a rat. The sight of this creature leaves you running out of the
room, immediately into a person whom you recognize very well.</p>

<p>"Hello there, inspector. I have come to inquire about your
progress"</p>

<p>The fact that Mr. Noyes personally came to visit you is suspicious
in itself, but you know from your experiences with this man that 
questioning him would always lead to a worse outcome. You explain
to him how you're doing, snarkily sneaking in how you could make
virtually no progress with the amount of time that he gave you before
feeling the need to barge in on your investigation.</p>

<p>Behind him and through the open door, you see an odd colour, 
however your expression at its otherworldly abnormality gives away to 
him what you have taken note of.</p>

<p>"You haven't seen a rat around here, have you?"</p>

<p>After explaining the inhuman rat that you saw exiting the bedroom,
he follows you into the room to look at the rat-hole. He asks you to
look into it.</p>

<p>Once you get on the floor to see the inside of the horrific rat-hole,
your fate is sealed. If the horrifying visuals on the inside had not
been enough to paralyze you of terror, Mr. Noyes Mason was holding you
at the ground such that you could not escape. From this hole in the
wall, a hole you should've blocked the moment you saw it not mentioned
in the letter, the abominable rat which chased you earlier came forth.</p>

<p>It is futile to attempt to give any justice to the horror that ensued.
An adequate description of the method by which the rat was able to cease
any function of your living body would be futile in capturing the complete
horror that was associated with the attack, so I will not attempt to. I
will not attempt to describe how your lungs ceased function, leaving you
slowly suffocating from a lack of oxygen in your body. And I will especially
not describe it because the senses which allowed you to hear such a
description have been turned off, and I estimate that they will never be
turned on again.
