# Randolph Carter

<p>We have been told by his servant that, on March 23rd, Randolph Carter
left his house in order to visit his family home in Arkham, Massachusetts.
This servant reports that all he brought with him was a strange box with
horrifying symbols on them, and that he knew there to be a silver key
in this box the prior week, when he had helped Carter open the box.</p>

<p>Based on the descriptions of Carter's destination, his car, and the box,
we believe that we have found where he either left or was taken from his
vehicle: halfway up the mountain to his family home, which has been 
abandoned for decades now. In his car, we have found the box that he was said 
to carry with him (and have taken it from the scene so that you are not haunted 
by its horrible engravings); however, we have thus far failed to locate the 
silver key which he was said to have on him at the time of his disappearance. 
We think that the locating of, or the definite inability to locate, this item 
will tell us more about what happened to Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>Our current theories are as follows:</p>

1. Mr. Carter needed to leave his vehicle (due to a possible break-down or
exhaustion of fuel) and either ascended the mountain to arrive at his house
or descended it to seek help. Either way, we believe he became lost and died
somewhere in the woods on the mountain.
2. Mr. Carter was stopped by another person on his way up the mountain, by
someone hostile who wanted to steal his silver key for some reason. This
would be supported by a definite inability to find the key, as this would
imply that someone stole it.

<p>We do not believe that Mr. Carter is still alive. However, if you find any
evidence suggesting otherwise, please collect it and let us know.</p>
