# August 2nd, 1922; Peak of Arkham Mountains
### Carters' Bedroom

<p>Odd...</p>

<p>This letter clearly indicates that there should be no holes
in the walls and nothing on the nightstand... the hole makes sense
if a rat had recently found its way into the house, but the telescope
and the locked box? Not so much...</p>

<p>So, which one do you investivate first?</p>

[Put on your gloves and look at the telescope](Box.md)

[Pry open the box and look at its contents](Telescope.md)
