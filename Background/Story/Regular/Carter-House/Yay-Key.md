### Randolph Carter's Kitchen

<p>You begin to walk towards the key-cabinet</p>

<p>However, while walking towards the key, you feel
a sharp pain in your foot. Looking down, you see a hole
in the floor, however, this hole is very clealy going downwards
into the floor, with nothing sticking out towards you.
However, your drops of blood on the floor beg to differ.</p>

<p> While you were looking around for anything else that
might have caused this pain in your foot, you see something
sticking out of the wall. You see a sphere-shaped bulge in
the wall. Now, this would be completely normal under most
circumstances. However, you clearly see a rat emerge from
this bulge in the wall; you saw a rat walk through a clear
solid piece of matter, now running towards you.</p>

<p>You decide that you do not want this rat to meet up with you.
You begin running towards the cabinet which you identified the
key to be in earlier. However, it is gone. When you reach
the corner of this circular room, you are met with no key, but
rather the sharp edge of the corner, sticking into your chest.</p>

<p>By all laws of geometry, that corner should not have impaled
you in the way that it did. In fact, by all known laws of geometry,
there should not have been a corner there at all. However, it
is indesputible that something from the walls of the room was impaling
you in this moment, slowly taking all life from your body.</p>

<p>Before your sense of hearing retired permenantly, you hear
one more thing from beyond the room:</p>

<p>"He better not have found that key, or that telescope. I
told you that trapping him here was too great a risk!"</p>

<p>"I think you have nothing to worry about, Keziah."</p>
