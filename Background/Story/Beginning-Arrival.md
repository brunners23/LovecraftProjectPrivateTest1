# August 2nd, 1922; Miskatonic Spring

<p>You arrive at the mountains on which Randolph Carter's house is located
only an hour before the sun sets on the city of Arkham, Massachucetts.
His car is located at the source of a river, which you know very well flows
down through the towns of Dunwich and Arkham, the water of which is used
for the infamous Arkham resovoir, and which inspired the name of the local
college, Miskatonic University. Searching Carter's car, you find everything 
that was described in the letter, except of course the extracted box and
missing key.</p>

<p>How hot it is! And the water... the water of the spring from which the
river originates looks like just the thing to cool you down. In fact, the
water even <b>SOUNDS</b> cool. But would indulging in a swim in this water be 
irresponsible when you have such an important task to deal with?</p>
