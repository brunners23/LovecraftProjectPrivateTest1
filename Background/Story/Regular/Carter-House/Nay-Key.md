### Randolph Carter's Kitchen

<p>You search around for more evidence in Carter's kitchen.
Walking around this oddly-shaped room, you notice that there
is a small spot of wall that is discoloured- a spot that you
would've sworn was not there seconds ago.</p>

<p>From this spot in the wall, you see a rat emerge. In truth,
it would be erroneous to say that this is what you see, as the
odd light waves that this rat emits are not easily readable by
your eyes accostumed to 1-dimensional wavelengths, and the
alignment of these relative objects is impossible to conclude
based on optics alone. However, you deduce that the strange
nature of this patch on the wall, which seemed to change back
to its normal colour by now, must be associated with the strange
appearance of this rat, neither seeming of this world in sight
nor sound.</p>

<p>You begin to run away from this rat as it runs towards you.
Simultaneously, you hear the door to Carter's house open, and
a weird, buzzing voice coming from the entrance to the house.
You know that you must escape, and you quickly identify an exit
route through an exit to the house attached to the kitchen.</p>

<p>When you leave Carter's house, you see that it is night.
Looking back, you seem to see a faint violet glow coming
from the inside. Additionally, when you reach the springs
at which you began your investigation, you see the water
glowing violet also.</p>


<p>You drive to Mr. Noyes Mason's office, hoping that he
will be there when you arrive. When you do, you find his
door locked, but as you look back towards your car, see his
pulling in right next to you. You realize that he had been
right behind you the whole drive back. You move towards him
to tell him of your findings ...</p>
