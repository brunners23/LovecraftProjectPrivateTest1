# August 2nd, 1922; Peak of Arkham Mountains
### Carters' Bedroom

<p>You take the telescope as evidence.</p>

<p>As you put the telescope in your pocket, you hear footsteps.
It is probably best to hide under the bed.</p>

<p>From your spot under the bed, you see three pairs of feet.
Two of these are normal- slightly archaic, but normal. One
of these two pairs looks extremely familiar, although you cannot
quite think of where you might remember it from. However, the
third pair of feet it the most intriguing, by far. It emits no
colour known to you from your experiences on this earth, and
is very clearly not a human foot, but rather something alien.</p>

<p>Someone begins to talk. You cannot see who it is, although
you can deduce that the speech is from neither of the human
feet, due to its unnatural buzzing, emitting a series of sine
waves that could not really be described as a sound at all.
You cannot make out many words from this sound, except a very
distinct instance of the word "telescope."</p>

<p>Have you touched something that you should not touch?</p>

<p>You hear drawers open. They are looking for it</p>

<p>The closet opens.</p>

<p>Closes.</p>

<p>" ... under ..."</p>

<p>The inhuman feet come closer to your spot under the bed</p>

<p>The sight that next comes to your eyes is impossible to
describe. There is no way to properly express its otherworldly
horror, no way to explain the unnatural geometries of its face,
and no way to describe how its body felt, which you now feel wrapping
itself around your arms. It is neither possible to describe anything
else that you felt in relation to this monster, nor anything you felt
in relationship to this mortal world after this encounter, for its
actions after grabbing the telescope from you, actions too horrible
and gruesome to describe in any detail without sending anyone
catching a glimpse of the description into the same state that
you are coming to find yourself in, these actions leave you from
all of your earthly senses indefinitely.</p>
