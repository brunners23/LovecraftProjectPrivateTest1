### Carters' Bedroom

<p>Upon entering the bedroom, you notice a small hole in the wall
to your right.</p>

<p>Upon inspecting the room, you notice nothing extremely abnormal.
The Carters' bed is well-kept, the room isn't a mess, and there
is nothing on his night-stand, save a telescope, a locked box, and 
an unopened letter. But why wasn't the letter opened? Perhaps this 
was left by the last person who was in this room, before it was
ultimately abandoned?</p>

[Reading the letter](Bedroom-Letter.md) will probably give you a better idea of any
abnormalities you should know about
