# August 2nd, 1922; Peak of Arkham Mountains
### Randolph Carter's Kitchen

<p>Upon entering the kitchen, you take a glimpse around.</p>

<p>Immediately catching your attention is a small cabinet in one
of the corners of the circular kitchen, a cabinet with a small
glass portion in it such that you can see through it. Looking
through this cabinet-window, you see a small silver key.</p>

<p>It certainly is strange that Mr. Noyes's men could not earlier
find this key in this location...</p>

Should you retrieve the key?

[Of course. It's perfect evidence!](Yay-Key.md)

[Nah, let's keep looking around](Nay-Key.md)
