# Artist's Statement

<p>This work, in order to invoke a sense of horror in the reader, 
puts them through a short story to establish a first-person narritive,
then proceeds to concoct an encounter with some Lovecraftian monster
that ultimately brings the reader to their demise. This was intended
originally to be a deeper choose-your-own adventure story, although
the vision of what it would become was short-ciruited by time
constraints not helped by a severe underestimation of the magnitude
of work associated with crafting such a story. What is left has 6
endings, 5 of which have something horrible very explicitly happen
to the reader. The last of these endings is to be taken in once
all of the other endings have been reached, as the ambiguous ending
of approaching Mr. Noyes is only understood to have a horrifying
result when the context of his full intentions that day are discovered.
These endings themselves are not what I tried to focus on for this 
project, nor was the subject of my attention the actual storyline
that I was crafting, but I rather decided to focus on how I would
invoke horror into the reader while they read through what their poor
persona suffers through (although the content of the endings do help to 
realize this goal). To accomplish this, I try to emulate some
of Lovecraft's writing style and common literary terms, especially
paralepsis and circumlocution. There are also moments of
synesthesia, especially when describing the colour found in the Miskatonic
Springs, which serve to associate a greater sense of mystery and
eeriness to this story; if you can hear and taste a colour, something
is wrong with the world that you are in. Finally, to further this
effect of mysteriousness surrounding this short story are instances
of extremely contradictory descriptions of the reader's surroundings,
for example, when describing the circular kitchen as having a
corner.</p>
