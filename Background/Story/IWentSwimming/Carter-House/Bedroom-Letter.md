<p>Report of Service</p>

[X] Make bed
[X] Clear night-stand
[X] Tidy and clean floor
[ ] Patch holes in the walls

<p>Note that I did not complete your request of patching the
holes in your walls because of the apparent lack of such holes.
However, I have made sure that nothing is left on your bed or 
floors, that the latter of these is void of any dust, and that
your nightstand is completely cleared (except for this note, 
obviously).</p>

<p>Money owed for work on this room: $5</p>
