<p>“Bigger’n a barn . . . all made o’ squirmin’ ropes . . . hull thing sort o’ shaped like a hen’s egg bigger’n anything, with dozens o’ legs like hogsheads that haff shut up when they step . . . nothin’ solid abaout it—all like jelly, an’ made o’ sep’rit wrigglin’ ropes pushed clost together . . . great bulgin’ eyes all over it . . . ten or twenty maouths or trunks a-stickin’ aout all along the sides, big as stovepipes, an’ all a-tossin’ an’ openin’ an’ shuttin’ . . . all grey, with kinder blue or purple rings . . . an’ Gawd in heaven—that haff face on top! . . .”</p>

<p>You regain your sight. You seem to be in some town, although
to call it a town at this point would be disrespectful to the memory
of the inhabitants who you can deduce once lived here. All of the
buildings seem destroyed, almost with no sign of them ever existing.</p>

<p>You begin to feel a slight chest pain</p>

<p>Upon examining the area, you notice something odd: an area of about
20 square feet of grass is sitting flatter than the surrounding terrain,
as if something is pushing it down. You see an identical, but mirrored,
area of grass a few feet to the left of this one.</p>

<p>Your chest pain grows slightly worse</p>

<p>After a moment, one of these areas in the grass disappears, only to
reappear again, about 10 feet closer to you. Then the area to the left
of this one catches up. Right... left... right...</p>

<p>You feel a warm stream running down the side of one of your legs.
Too focused on your increasing chest pain and the odd patches of
grass that you do not bother to look down at this stream. It doesn't
matter. The sight of that red, flowing liquid would do nothing to
save you from your fate.</p>

<p>Left... Right... Left... Right... Left...</p>

<p>The patches of grass stop moving mere feet in front of you. You
feel air brush your side, as if someone attempted to swipe at you
on your right, but narrowly missed. You attempt to run, but your
legs are numb, almost as if your heart has disappeared and cannot
deliver blood to it. You are left to stand still, left to suffer
the horror of whatever stands in front of you at this moment, with
no control.</p>

<p>Your chest pain reaches unprecedented levels, and looking down
at its source, you see a stained, red pool in your shirt.</p>

<p>Then you feel a force equal to that of 10 giant houses falling upon
you.</p>

<p>You have less than a second left of sight in your feeble life left.
In this snapshot of time, you see above you Carter's bed, completely messy
as if you were thrashing about in it. You see a sea of what you presume 
to be your own blood.</p>

<p>The last thing you see before your eyes permenantly close is a rat,
resembling more a human in both face and feet, carrying a mess of
muscles, carrying what was your heart.</p>
